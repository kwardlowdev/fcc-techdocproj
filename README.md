# An Intro To Brainfuck

### Nature Of This Project
This is one of the projects from my freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification curriculum. I am putting it on Github in order to display my progress in web design and also to be able to revisit this project in the future to refine and improve it as I improve my abilities. 

This is a simple technical document that profiles the esoteric programming language Brainfuck, and breaks down a sample program that I wrote in BF. I tried to style it to look similar to old CRT screens

As it is one of the required projects from fCC (as opposed to the guided code projects), the code in it is solely my own though the specifications for the structure of it was strictly stipulated by the site itself in some respects (some id and class naming). 

### Potential Improvements

I hope to revisit this, refine the styling, and improve the organizational structure and information of the document itself as I learn more in design and development.
